# Assignment 1 of PRML

## Introduction

In this assignment, four requirements are listed below:

- What will happen when we varies the number of data used?
- How the number of bins of Histogram affects the estimation?
- Try different *h* for Kernel Method
- Vary *K* in Nearest Neighbor Method

And they will be solved case by case. But before that, I will give a brief *summery* of the details I will discuss in this paper.

**Method Used**: Histogram Method, Kernel Method and the Nearest Neighbor Method

**Goal**: Estimate the distribution of a given dataset. And try to figure out how the parameters of these methods affects the result.

- Requirement One
  - How the number of samples affects the result?
  - Using suggested numbers for testing the three methods.
  - Find some more details in #TODO
- Requirement Two
  - Consider Histogram Method
  - Figure out how the number of bins affects the result
  - How to pick out the best choice for the number?
- Requirement Three
  - Figure out how the volume of the box affects the result
  - And how to choose a better *h* for estimation
  - Using a dataset of 100 samples. Try to get a best figure by choosing a suitable *h*
- Requirement Four
  - Plot an illustration
  - Show the method isn't always valid
    - Empirical way
    - Theoretical way
